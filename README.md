# iRoomba
A Python implementation of 2 types of "Roomba" autonomous robots

The program creates and implements the functionality of 2 types of robotic vaccum cleaners:
  - Standard Robot- Runs until it hits a wall, then changes directions
  - Random Robot- Changes direction after each time step
  
Program implements a visual representation of the 2 robots cleaning a rectangular room object:

The program finishes by comparing the run times of the 2 robots with varying number of robots and also various aspect ratios within a rectangular room:
